Registration Scenario
_____________________

Command: ./sipp -sf CliRegister.xml -inf UserDB.csv -r 10 -trace_stat -m 1000 -i 10.0.2.15 -p 5067 10.0.2.15
-sf; scenario file
-inf; Injection file
-r n; -r is the call rate, and n represents any positive integer.
-trace_stat; show results of call
-m n; Stop the test when n number of calls have been processed
-i; local ip
-p; local port
10.0.2.15; remote host parameter

In the benchmarking of the registration with the server, the -r parameter was shifted from 50, to 100, 150 and 200.
The -m parameter was kept static at 1000 calls.


Caller Client scenario
______________________

Command: ./sipp -sf callc1.xml -inf UserDB.csv -r n -trace_stat -m 1000 -i 10.0.2.15 -p 5067 10.0.2.15
-sf; scenario file
-inf; Injection file
-r n; -r is the call rate, and n represents any positive integer.
-trace_stat; show results of call
-m n; Stop the test when n number of calls have been processed
-i; local ip
-p; local port
10.0.2.15; remote host parameter

In the benchmarking of the callhandler server scenario, the -r parameter was shifted from 50, to 100, and then 150.
The m parameter was kept static.

Server/Callhandler scenario
___________________________

Command: ./sipp -sf calls1.xml -inf UserDB.csv -r n-trace_stat -m 1000 -i 10.0.2.15 -p 5067 10.0.2.15
-sf; scenario file
-inf; Injection file
-r n; -r is the call rate, and n represents any positive integer.
-trace_stat; show results of call
-m n; Stop the test when n number of calls have been processed
-i; local ip
-p; local port
10.0.2.15; remote host parameter

In the benchmarking of the call client scenario, the -r parameter was shifted from 50, to 100, and then 150.
The m parameter was kept static.
